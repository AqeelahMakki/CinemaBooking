# Cinema Booking

This is a JAVA project for my **object oriented programming II** course.

The idea of the project is to apply knowledge of GUI and file reading\writing.

## explaining contents

- _Reserve.java_ is where the user book a movie using combo boxes, and saves the data in a file.
- _Info.java_ is where we get the users information and apply some validation technique, and saves the data in a file.
- _Completed.java_ is where the information of the reservation is printed out from the previous files along with a QR code.

# Issues

for some reason the **_Completed.java_** alwayes prints an old Info in the first Text Area, meaning that the first attempt will give you an empty text area and the second will print the old info
